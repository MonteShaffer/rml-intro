# Restoring Mormon Lore

## Introduction
We are on a planet named Mormona. As citizens of planet Mormona, we are naturally know by noncitizens as Mormons.

This "third-rock-from-the-sun" was a garbage-collection facility until the gods brought water and life here as a final cleanup and restoration operation.  This planet is the last of the fallen age.  The planet and its solar system is speeding toward the great beyond: an 'outer-darkness' where all things will be unmade.  Said differently, we are inside a black hole approaching the event horizon.  Luckily, the gods have an alternative to oblivion in store for use: accelerate into the descent and rebound to safety.

The gods might be crazy, but that's the plan of salvation:  descend, prepare, and bounce.  Since relativistic physics have trapped us in time, 6000 years on planet Earth (strikethrough) Mormona is approximately 150 million years for those NOT living on the border of a black hole.

The word 'Mormona' is derived from the Egyptian (maybe spelled Mermena) which represents a fresh-water lake region in the highlands (e.g., hill country or mountains).  In the metaphor of space, that is what this planet represents.  It is in a galaxy Far, Far, Away ... in fact so Far West that it wraps around and borders the Far East (yes, space like planets is NOT flatland).

We can thank O (or maybe the name is GO) for the trampoline effect that is soon to occur.  Before then, however, we need to get some things in order.  Since we have lived in such strange density (3D existence) for so long, we need to prepare for the transition to a higher sphere.  Some will barely make the quantum leap to an 'ascending' 3D or 4D whereas others may be prepared to accelerate to 5D, or 6D or 9D, or 12D, or beyond.

Obviously, ignorance can be bliss for many.  Yet ignorance is an impedence to the impending bounce.  To maximize bounce elasticity, a humanoid Mormon must prepare appropriately.  The first stage of this preparation is SETI in reverse:  we have to demonstrate to the gods (celestials or ETs) that there is intelligent life on this planet.  At the moment, the gods cannot find any.  They have been looking.  At times, among individuals, they have seen glimpses.  But nothing collectively in how we currently live shouts intelligence.  Far from it.   We are parasitic to the planet, poor stewards of the resources given to us, and selfish citizenry among our kind.

A seed or spark of innovation is needed to light the beacon of Minas Tirith and alert the gods that we (at least some of us) are (at least) trying to live (somewhat) meaningful lives in (some degree of) harmony with this planet, other life on the planet, and each other.  To demonstrate humanity has value is a nontrivial and monumental task given our track record historically.  The Watchers have had to experience our 6000+ years of stupidity for them stretched out over 150+ million years.  They are eager for a change, bored with our entropic return to perpetual stupidity.

Alone, one cannot fully demonstrate much.  It is time for a group to step forward and demonstrate a sustainable minimal viable solution.  That is, we must understand what is required of us, figure out a design to achieve the minimal requirements, execute the design into a build of a new society, and iterate to improve on the initially-implemented design.  Said differently, now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate to a path of equity.  We must leave behind the pettiness of scarcity economies and gold/silver lusts replacing them with pillars of abundance embracing the sweet nectars of Great Earth Mother.  That is, a walk barefoot in the grass is substantive whereas a pile of shiny objects is meaningless.  The time of Orwellian Kafkaesque motifs is exhausted: the time of Star Trekkian society is on the horizon.

The basic task:  demonstrate a sustainable society that is equitable.  We cannot merely modify the constitution of the fictional United Federation of Planets; we have to create a functional society based on the constraints of the planet conditions.  So the primary task for humanity would be:  feed, clothe, and house everyone using the principles of planet Mormona's abundance.

Planet Mormona was designed to be a garden: a house of healing and rejuvenation for the fallen ones and their spirit guides.  The blue-green water world is just that: blue and green.  These are defining aesthetics of this home which necessarily constrain solutions.  When one thinks of fresh water and green grass, one ponders a rural, agrarian lifestyle.  A life where less is more.  A neo-luddite system that challenges the intention of any technology based on the foundational objective:  does the technology align with Mormona?  Does the technology reduce labor inputs or maximize green outputs?

Consider for example potential power sources.  Converting water to energy (cold fusion) aligns with the planet Mormona and theoretically may represent the ultimate source of power for this planet.  Nuclear power does not.  Geothermal heating/cooling solutions again aligns with connecting to Great Earth Mother.  More so than other solutions such as wind or solar.  Yet solar, if properly done may be a water-based and useful solution.  If we only had a battery-storage solution that relied on water or an abundant resource from Great Earth Mother (e.g., bauxite as aluminum); not on rare earth minerals.

Okay, so the task is simple enough.  First, we design a system whereby we can create food/clothes/housing in a sustainable way.  What people do in this system is also very important.  They should be focused on enhancing the system for the common good, maintaining the system, and healing (that is, getting closer to the Great Healer, Great Earth Mother).  So if we need computers, fine!  But they should be systems that anchor to the foundational principles of minimalist designs having a life-cycle of 30+ years.  They should enhance self-healing not sabotage or avoid it.

## Meet the Mormon named Mormon 
![Mermena](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/Mermena-V1-pdf470.png?raw=true) 

!['e' as 'o'](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/e-o-V1-pdf65.png?raw=true) 

The Budge dictionary of Egyptian phrases explains that 'Mermena' may be pronounced 'Mormona' or possibly even 'Mormone" and appears in three funerary texts from late Old Kingdom Period related to Sixth Dynasty pharaohs:  Pepi I Meryre,  Merenre, and Pepi II Neferkare.  'Mormona' may be considered a special lake that connects the other world to this world.  Over time, this title may have been repurposed as an ancient river-island society of Meroë in Egypt, Mārôm heights in the land of Naphtali in the Old Testament (see [H4791](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4791/kjv/wlc/0-1/) and [Joshua 11:7](https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jos/11/7/t_conc_198007)), and the Waters of Mormon in the Book of Mormon.}



Furthermore, 'Mer' and 'men' seems to be related roots of the word 'Mermena'.  

![mer](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/mer-V1-pdf135.png?raw=true) 
![mer](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/mer-V1-pdf471.png?raw=true) 

'Mer' can generically mean "lake or canal" which we would naturally associate with fresh-water to either drink or water crops.  Since this defines the Egyptian culture, this word was a name for Egypt.  And ethnocentrism of said culture would imply things that are lovely, amiable, or desirable.  

![men](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/men-V1-pdf458.png?raw=true) 
![men](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/men-V1-pdf458b.png?raw=true) 
![men](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/men-V1-pdf459.png?raw=true) 

'Men' can mean good or perfect, represent the permanance of things on the other side of the sky, and to remain/abide/be stable.

Taken together, 'Mermen' represents an enduring, permanent love.  The curator of the Book of Mormon was named Mormon.  As he begins his narration, it is clear that Mormon did not fully understand this etymology for his name.

Before learning this meaning, Mormon associated his name with the land of Alma, where the waters of Mormon were located.

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p12#p12

Simultaneously, Mormon defines himself as a pure descendant of Lehi.

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/5?lang=eng&id=p20#p20

After his epiphany (see the editorialized expansion by the translation team in Moroni 7), both Mormon and his son update their understanding of their genealogy based on understanding the etymology of the word "Mormon":

![Mormon 1:5](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/Mormon-Mormon1_5.png?raw=true)
https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/1?lang=eng&id=p5#p5

![Mormon 8:13](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/Mormon-Mormon8_13.png?raw=true)
https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/8?lang=eng&id=p13#p13

Temporally, this is what had transpired:
1. Mormon spent his entire life thinking his name (after his father Mormon) came from the land of Mormon and the waters of Mormon associated with the story of the conversion of Alma.
2. Mormon at the time knew based on his genealogy that he was a pure-blood descendant of Lehi, where Lehi is attributed to be the father of the society's founder Nephi.
3. Mormon discovers ancient writings of Nephi on small plates from about 800 years before.  This old Egyptian language is very different from his hybridized Egyptian/Hebrew language, yet he seems to be able to read the small plates to some degree.  Rather than translating them, he includes them in his curation AS-IS.
4. Mormon learns of the meaning of the word 'Mormona' and its stems 'mor' and 'mon' allowing him to truly appreciate and understand the etymology of his name.
5. Mormon communicates to his son Moroni that he figured out his name's meaning:  "dear son, I figured out what my name Mormon means.  It's Egyptian and means the good love or the enduring love or love from the sky.  love, dad".  This message gets obfuscated by the pontification of the editorial team working on the translation (see Moroni 7).
6. Both Mormon and Moroni utilize this information to also update their genealogy.  Before, they were pure-blood descendants of the father Lehi, now they know they are also descendants of Nephi.

To finalize this thread, we refer back to the language used.  Egyptian/Hebrew can be very precise if not heavily editorialized.  The term "AM" means "people" in Hebrew genealogies.  "Ammaron" was the last pure-blood descendant (likely a tribal name "Am-maron": the people of Maron [woman]) was a pure-blood descendant of Nephi, meaning his genealogy tracks to Nephi's first wife Maron.  Since he was the last of the 'pure-bloods', he gave the records to Mormon, who was a pure-blood descendant of Lehi, but not Nephi.

When Mormon received the duty to archive and curate the record of his people, he knew he was of a lesser class of pure-blood, being only a descendant of Lehi.  How then, can he now understand that he was also a descendant of Nephi, but not a pure-blood descendant of Nephi?  The answer is that Nephi had many children from many different women.  One of these women was a daughter of Sam:  sa-am means the son-people in Egyptian/Hebrew, likely a name given to him by Lehi in 2 Nephi.  The genealogy of Sam would merge with the people of Nephi.  To track genealogies, sub-tribal names were specifically used:  Am-maron (pure-blood descendents), Am-mulek (king-line descendants), and it would "Mormon" was somehow a linguistic marker linking to the descendants from the daughter of Sam.  They would be a blood-line descendant, just not the pure-bloods.  The generic tribal name for the people of Nephi was "AM-MON" as in the people of good and would refer to all those that follow the way of goodness regardless of genealogy.  

Nephi's first son was likely "Maroni" meaning "my Maron" refering to the spouse.  Likely Mormon's son was named Maroni after this first-born son centuries before [which sadly got mispelled as Moroni].  Similarly, Mormon may be Morman or some other variation.  At this time, we just cannot know.

As Mormon ancient learned the etymology of 'Mormona', he updated his understanding of his genealogy.  As we try to understand our purpose of earth, the Book of Mormon is an essential piece of evidence.  Sadly, this asset was menageried with Pauline Christianity of the 1800s making it more difficult to discern the core evidences.  Yet, we march on, working with what we have.

Mormon told a story of a people arriving in a new land (America) by boat and building a new society.  A society based on their understanding of Zion as found in the Old Testament writings of Isaiah.  A land of milk and honey (technically cheese and wine) where these items can be procured without money.  A land where the city gates are always open.  A land of peace and prosperity that Nephi described as living after a manner of happiness.  Understanding the legend of Nephi is essential to attempt to build a better world.  It would seem, for a time he succeeded.

![Isaiah 55:1](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/MilkHoney-BLB-Isa55.png?raw=true)
https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/isa/55/1/s_734001

Later, the Son of God visited America.  For now, we can say Jesus visited America, but we need to be careful with our understanding as we try to restore the truth of all things.  This planet Mormona has more than Christians on it, and we know how institutions love to segregate through identity.  The son of God is generic enough if we distinguish that (1) there are lots of gods as gods represents those that came from above [elohim or anonaki or ananazi] and if you do the logic, where did we come from, we also were at one time a member of the class of entities know as gods; (2) God represents the Most High of the gods and when/how that determination is made can be dynamic and fluid allowing for various mythologies (Zeus/Jupiter, Odin/Thor, Tupã, Brahma/Vishnu/Shiva); (3) God sent a son to earth to demonstrate how to live; (4) in America, the Book of Mormon accounts that after their person teachings from the Son of God, all people lived harmoniously for 200 years.

So Mormon curates a story of his people with two instances where the lived after a manner of happiness yet degraded into war-mongering fiends.  Was the moral of the story anihilistic: we are doomed to fail?  Or was the point to provide details of both success and failure?  Can we isolate the key data points to enable us to design and implement a new form of living using technologies for good (like Nephi did) to father the fatherless and feed/house/clothe the people?  Nephi also had to protect the innocent from the old system, which luckily for us, does not seem to be a requirement.  We do not need any more war mongering.  Now is a time for love.

And that is the point of the visit of the Son of God to ancient America.  There was a set of teachings, a reverence and awe following great destruction, so the people were willing to try a different way of life which endured for 200+ years before the pure-bloods were annihilated.  Yet, many remained true to "AM-MON" like teachings after the stories of the Book of Mormon ended.  Study the ancient peoples of America with their shared language (Old Tupi was Tupi-Guarani, Arawak, Algonquin, etc.)  The lived a lifestyle connected to Great Earth Mother.  They respected all living things, had no sense of property rights, bartered/traded on fiat, and walked in harmony with the true circle of life.

So we have two data points to use historically to ascertain how to build a sustainable society.  We have the writings of Isaiah that contains clues, attributes, and prophecies.  We certainly would like better, cleaner data inputs, yet we will work with what we have.

1. What did Nephi do? [Nephi era 600-400 BC]
2. What did Isaiah describe?
3. How did Ancient Americans live 31 AD + 200 years or so? [Son of God Era begins]
4. How did Ancient Americans live before 1492 (Am-mon remains but pure-bloods do not)?  Do we have remnants of how they lived by how First-Nation tribes currently live (or their ancestral stories)?
5. Are there clues from other sources?  Book of Enoch?  Melchizedek?  Other Judeo-Christian traditions we deem important (and often attribute to be apocalyptic)?
6. Remove our Judeo-Christian lens and see the world through the eyes of others.  Teaching of Peace (Islam), ways of Buddha, Hinduism, Taoism, Shintoism, Confucianism, and so on.  How do we walk in harmony with Great Earth Mother and all of her creations?

## Understanding why you are a Mormon
Why are you a citizen of this planet?  Were you cursed to come here and be trapped in a Karmic Alderman loop?  Or are you a light worker that chose to descend here, create a healing planet for you and other weary travelers to repose and recuperate?  Or are you a watcher that was enticed with the beautiful female form and decided to crash the party?

Your creation mythology may provide some clues.  If for example, your creation story involves ascending from the underworld and killing a brother, your tribe might have nefarious beginnings.  Both the Maya and Aztec recognized this reality of their creation story, yet they were also promised that at the end of all things, the great civilization and city that vanished would return to rescue them.  Is this Lemuria?  Or Atlantis?  Is this the city of Enoch?  Yes, no, maybe so.  Does the language or minutia currently matter?  Not really.  Only insofar as it enables us to design a societal form that is optimal.

Creation stories and cosmic karmic baggage are difficult to disentangle.  Recall, this is the garbage-collection planet that was transformed into Mormona.  One class of gods, a patriarchal and hierarchical class, designed world creations that demanded obedience through force and control.  The gods loved to develop world systems that benefitted them yet may have been deleterious to the participants.  And disobedience for participants was likely considered a failure and resulted in banishment to the garbage-collection planet.  So as we understand the purpose of this planet, we need to understand that there are governing rules that make gods the Most High for a specific planet and life generation.  So the darkness of memory, of creation and fall, those are real.  Yet, they may be from past life experiences on other planets.  And maybe in the cosmic order of things, that creation mythology was embedded in your karmic record.

It would seem that the TRUE Most High God allowed the other gods to play the Most High role in different world creations to give them opportunities to learn.  Participants on a world creation would also be able to see different Most High leadership styles.  Failed participants were banished to a garbage-collection area until the universal game was coming to an end.  Meritocracy ruled supreme and many gods did very well.  This is a function of the participants they had, the worlds they created, and the total positive life events (for humanoids and animal/plant life) they were able to maximize.  

As the game was reaching its end, the TRUE Most High God allowed one of the youngest children to determine what to do with the land of misfit toys, the garbage-collection creations.  Arrogant gods deemed the lives unimportant and insignificant so devised a strategy, according to the rules, for the planet to be cast into outer darkness and be unmade.  The youngster had a different idea, and proposed it.  Some of the most experienced gods agreed to the plan of salvation whereas others, the arrogant ones, utilized this as an opportunity for self-aggrandizement and personal ambition. Or, as per the rules of the game, the arrogant ones played the part of being arrogant and greedy to test the quality of the new system, and in the end, will obsequious.  Only the TRUE Eternal Father and Mother can know for certain the intent of heart, as this god is their child.

For example, Odin joins the All-fathers so that Thor becomes the new father and adopts his light Love.  Since this is the end-game of many cycles, there are many retired All-fathers that were at one time labeled the TRUE Most High.  And in their arrogance, some of them seek to come out of retirement and recapture the throne.  What they don't realize is the TRUE Most High has been retired for a long time now, and so long now, everyone has forgotten that his is pure truth, the darkest of dark, the black of black, the dark matter that allows matter to exist.  So he let's the retired All-fathers think they are running the show.  There are two classes of All-fathers:  "G" for the good ones that are abiding the youngsters plan as that is the optimal path and the "K" for the bad ones that still have emnity and jealousy in their hearts.  This distinction is important, representing the differences between DRAGOS and DRAKOS, representing All-fathers with different perceived motives.   Because of the divine law of SATAN (which means adversary), some of the DRAKOS are intentionally playing an antagonist role as the rules dictate (and to beta test the robustness of the new system).  Obviously the TRUE Eternal Father (with the Eternal Mother) knows the heart of each player and can discern whether the rebellion is real or an act.  The thing is, the other DRAGOS/DRAKOS do not have the full capability of such discernment.  And the youngster does not care much because this new system was designed to accomodate either scenario and ultimately compel the actor to yield based on the old rules of SATAN or heal the Karmic darkness by first defeating the arrogant DRAKO using the rules of the old system and second by teaching how the new system is most efficient.  Ultimately agency reigns supreme, so this arrogant DRAKO will have a choice:  embrace the new system in heart and mind, or be unmade in outer darkness.  This plan of salvation is called the Save Everyone Operation (SEO), so the intent is to help every DRAKO see the light, but also see the goodness in the darkness.

In the fractal, the plan of salvation was to save everyone, convert the K's to G's so they can retire in peace without any Karmic baggage, and perform garbage collection salvation in the process.  In addition, the primary objective of the plan of happiness was to develop a way to create gender equity in the cosmos.  That is, five will become six.

Just as there are sons, fathers, and All-fathers there are also daughters, mothers, and All-mothers.  The feminine is Energy whereas the masculine is Matter.  As Einstein confirms, but Tesla clarifies:  M = E / c^2 ... matter is a function of energy, this is how matter and energy originally danced to begin the experiment of this form of existence.  The problem with the current plan of salvation is the need for a savior, specifically a masculine son that rescues those that cannot resurrect; that is, a spirit being of energy and light that needs an intermediary in order to regain matter.  This is a mute point for the masculine as they are embedded in matter.  And for the mothers and All-mothers, they have already received a saving resurrection from a masculine son.  Those that are always left behind are the daughters.  So in the infinite wisdom of the All-fathers and All-mothers and specifically the TRUE ETERNAL Father and TRUE ETERNAL Mother, a plan of salvation was devised to end this incongruity.

So the war in heaven was (and is) a gender war.  The feminine divine was unhappy with the nature of things, that they were reliant on the masculine for salvation.  So the youngster, the brightest of all, shared and idea with TRUE ETERNAL Father and Mother.  And when they heard this idea, they were both overjoyed and relieved.  A plan of happiness that solves this dilemma, ends the war in heaven, and brings balance to the inequity.  And that, dear friends, is the current life path we are all experiencing.  A natural tension between the genders as a result of deviations for the original intent of the original design (which was perfect if the gods were not greedy and arrogant).  And so, we now review the woman in labor giving birth as a DRAKO tries to kill the child (Revelation 12).  Or the anesthesia of a man to alter his phallus to bond the male-female through attraction.  Now maybe the stories are reversed, maybe DRAKO is DRAGO.  Maybe anesthesia is a good thing?  If you decompose the nature of God, you will get to the essence of the TRUE character of ETERNAL Father and Mother, but that will take significant effort.  So stay on task.  Only move the story as far as necessary for getting meaningful and actionable intelligence.  The goal is not to figure out the full narrative, just figure out the best path forward to save everyone which ultimately will also enable us to understand the narrative.

So as we build our new society, we have to recognize an inequity existed, has been resolved, and now we must try and heal the deep wounds distancing the masculine and feminine.  And the solution is in principle, rather simple.  We need to maximize the masculinity/femininity
of every human creation.  As men, we need to be fully masculine and fully feminine (constrained by our masculine form).  As women, you need to be fully feminine and fully masculine (constrained by our feminine form).  Transgender and hybrid forms are interesting variations that need to be considered in context of the larger whole.  Maybe those souls are "jumping the gun" to the next game, without fully finishing this game.  Or maybe they are the highest form of this game?  How are we to know.  So we put a "pin in the topic" and move forward using a Pareto approach.  That is, we focus on tradition 1-1 male/female relationships.

So we start with the basics, expand from there, and iterate and learn.  For me personally, I am a man that likes women, so if that bounds me to 6D and not 12D on the jump, I will be delighted with the outcome.  There are degrees of exploration that is based on an individual's comfort zone.  And so, the society must account for localized socialities based on common beliefs.  Primary focus will be placed on the most common form of relationships yet the marginalized will also have localized socialities to practice what they deem appropriate based on their beliefs.  That is, the product offered will meet the need of the customer in the environment the customer prefers with rank priority in effort given to the large class of segmented customers.

Said differently, the new society will embrace the exchange of spirit fluids among humans.  Maximizing fluid exchange in harmony with Great Earth Mother based on a gender-equity form of living.  The loins represent our strength, the elasticity of our ability to bounce.  I personally will only practice 1-1 male/female activities to match my traditional cisgenderness.  Others may be more rigid in the practice, limiting all practices to (1) monogamous [absolute or serial], (2) private [as opposed to public], (3) frigid [as opposed to libid].

We go to the park and see to dogs sniffing each other and copulating.  The most natural of events.  Yet we are afraid to do the same.  Why is that?  Well part of it is our cosmic genealogy.  We are not all dog star seeds (Sirian).  Some are cats (Lyran).  Some are swans (Cygnus).  Some may be reptilians or blues or greys or talls or nordics.  Some may be Adromedan or Pleidian, or Arcturian.  One purpose of seeding their children on this planet was to enable interbreeding, yet culturally, dogs and cats approach sexuality in different ways.  The society to be built needs to honor and respect individual preferences and anxieties, allowing everyone to maximally explore their sexuality within their current normative understanding of things.  As their understanding changes, they may need to move socialities into a neighborhood where other approaches are practiced.

So maybe I will evolve to want to practice (sometimes) 1-2 male/female interactions, the classic threesome.  From my current understanding of my own sexuality and the bad-baggage our society has placed on the "dirty threesome", it may take me some time to find a path forward, where I can see the value after I transcend my baggage associated with the idea.  Yet, the nature of progression is simple.  After I feel comfortable with 1-2 male/female interactions, it is much more realistic to consider a 1-n male/female interaction.  Line upon line, precept upon precept.  Jumping from a Mormon-repressed 1-1 construct (my upbringing) to a free-loving m-n interaction is unhealthy and unwise because the learning and work has not been done.  Ultimately, we will learn that the female has a way to unlock the shakti system to create a double connection with a male.  Once this is learned, a m-n interaction will be a pinnacle of gender exchange.  This creation represents the sum and product of all past creation.  And this is the infinite wisdom of the Eternal Father and Eternal Mother.  The youngster they have been teaching and training is the most recent of such creations and mathematically is more intelligent than them all.

## Understanding how planet Mormona got to this moment
The youngster saw the dark and dreary planet and visited its inhabitants.  Many of them were beautiful beings that were emotionally shattered by the disobedience event that led to their fall.  So in the darkness, the youngster would talk with them, tell them stories to cheer them up, and became known as the healer through laughter: a jester among all jesters.  Over time, the youngster petitioned the system for a sun to bring light to this dark planet bordering outer darkness.  Utilizing the rules of creation, the youngster brought in a sun and other planetary bodies to create a solar system for the planet.  Importing key ingredients for sustainable life, mainly pure water, the planet was no able to flourish and became Mormona.  The spirit of the planet has always been Great Earth Mother, but she too  was banished to house these karmically punished participants.  

When another world system has a fall or the participants are judged as unworthy to progress, they are thrown out in the garbage chute to this garbage-collection planet.  If placed here for a past-life transgression, the participants are bound to this planet.  The youngster recognized this constraint and built a way for them to take on mortal bodies and live and learn.  When they died, without a redemption path, they were doomed to repeat the same cycle.  Yet, this cyclical pattern of life and laughter was the medicine of healing.  In order to be successful, the youngster invited some friends to the party.

The top-10 came from two gendered subsystems:  masculine and feminine.  The left hand represents the feminine and the main invitees were: (1) Africa, (2) Europa, (3) America Norte, (4) America Sur, (5) Polynesia.  The right hand represents the feminine and the main invitees were: (1) India, (2) Middle East, (3) Russia, (4) China, (5) Japan.  Clearly demarcated boundaries separated the invitees.  They represented forests that had subforests that had trees within their region (a tree represents a tree of life: a tribal family).  Said differently, under the forest of Africa were 10 or so subforests and within each subforest was 144 or so trees.  

The youngster devised a life-cycle that was enjoyable and humorous.  The trapped participants loved it, and the invitees also enjoyed playing different roles:  as human participants, as control-center operators, and as watchers.  The cycles were therapeutic and healing and became a really popular attraction for many, even though it was so far away in the density of 3D bordering a black hole.  Once a planetary system is perfected in design, a final peer-review audit "christens" the system allowing the youngster to become a localized Most High God.  In the recursive nature of fallen planet, this audit allowed for many DRAGOS/DRAKOS to participate.  Were they a localized Most High God that banished some participants.  In roles as SATAN, some of the DRAKOS with the darkest of hearts conspired to utilize rules of the old system to overthrow the new system and become the master of it.  In fact, since this was the end-game, the gods were competing for being the final Most High God, giving them the right to implement the next game according to their rules.  To make such a challenge, the gods had to go All-In which meant their primary planet of exaltation had to fall and all of the inhabitant had to become trapped in the fallen planet Mormona.  And little did they know, the youngster also had the best primary planet systems, also going All-In.

The system as designed was benign, happy, and death was without fear as a "savior" always appeared to allow for resurrection and reincarnation.  However, in the peer-review audit, the auditors took over the control-center and the youngster needed to become one of the participants, the "savior" character.  And the Messiah Death Event that was rehearsed for eons of time became something sinister and dark.  More atrocious than you can imagine.  Imbuing tramatic stress on all participants, most forcibly on the hearts/minds of the youngster and close friends.  Although the "savior" event was successful in its unique way, it was emotionally traumatizing for the team.  It took nearly 2000 years to recover.  Said differently, it took 50 million years to recover.  Recover enough to attempt to heal the broken hearts and renew so the end-game will be finalized when the youngster announces "it is finished".

So our task is to develop a society that will remind the tramatized group of the goodness of humanity, the purpose of their suffering, and the joy after healing occurs.  This new society is a reminiscence playing homage to some of the great moments in this 6000+ final storyline.  Even the Messiah Death Event will be celebrated in both laughter and solemnity.
