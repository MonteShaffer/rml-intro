# Restoring Mormon Lore

## Introduction
We are on a planet named Mormona. As citizens of planet Mormona, we are naturally know by noncitizens as Mormons.

This "third-rock-from-the-sun" was a garbage-collection facility until the gods brought water and life here as a final cleanup and restoration operation.  This planet is the last of the fallen age.  The planet and its solar system is speeding toward the great beyond: an 'outer-darkness' where all things will be unmade.  Said differently, we are inside a black hole approaching the event horizon.  Luckily, the gods have an alternative to oblivion in store for use: accelerate into the descent and rebound to safety.

The gods might be crazy, but that's the plan of salvation:  descend, prepare, and bounce.  Since relativistic physics have trapped us in time, 6000 years on planet Earth (strikethrough) Mormona is approximately 150 million years for those NOT living on the border of a black hole.

The word 'Mormona' is derived from the Egyptian (maybe spelled Mermena) which represents a fresh-water lake region in the highlands (e.g., hill country or mountains).  In the metaphor of space, that is what this planet represents.  It is in a galaxy Far, Far, Away ... in fact so Far West that it wraps around and borders the Far East (yes, space like planets is NOT flatland).

We can thank O (or maybe the name is GO) for the trampoline effect that is soon to occur.  Before then, however, we need to get some things in order.  Since we have lived in such strange density (3D existence) for so long, we need to prepare for the transition to a higher sphere.  Some will barely make the quantum leap to an 'ascending' 3D or 4D whereas others may be prepared to accelerate to 5D, or 9D, or 12D, or beyond.

Obviously, ignorance can be bliss for many.  Yet ignorance is an impedence to the impending bounce.  To maximize bounce elasticity, a humanoid Mormon must prepare appropriately.  The first stage of this preparation is SETI in reverse:  we have to demonstrate to the gods (celestials or ETs) that there is intelligent life on this planet.  At the moment, the gods cannot find any.  They have been looking.  At times, among individuals, they have seen glimpses.  But nothing collectively in how we currently live shouts intelligence.  Far from it.   We are parasitic to the planet, poor stewards of the resources given to us, and selfish citizenry among our kind.

A seed or spark of innovation is needed to light the beacon of Minas Tirith and alert the gods that we (at least some of us) are (at least) trying to live (somewhat) meaningful lives in (some degree of) harmony with this planet, other life on the planet, and each other.  To demonstrate humanity has value is a nontrivial and monumental task given our track record historically.  The Watchers have had to experience our 6000+ years of stupidity for them stretched out over 150+ million years.  They are eager for a change, bored with our entropic return to perpetual stupidity.

Alone, one cannot fully demonstrate much.  It is time for a group to step forward and demonstrate a sustainable minimal viable solution.  That is, we must understand what is required of us, figure out a design to achieve the minimal requirements, execute the design into a build of a new society, and iterate to improve on the initially-implemented design.  Said differently, now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate to a path of equity.  We must leave behind the pettiness of scarcity economies and gold/silver lusts replacing them with pillars of abundance embracing the sweet nectars of Great Earth Mother.  That is, a walk barefoot in the grass is substantive whereas a pile of shiny objects is meaningless.  The time of Orwellian Kafkaesque motifs is exhausted: the time of Star Trekkian society is on the horizon.

The basic task:  demonstrate a sustainable society that is equitable.  We cannot merely modify the constitution of the fictional United Federation of Planets; we have to create a functional society based on the constraints of the planet conditions.  So the primary task for humanity would be:  feed, clothe, and house everyone using the principles of planet Mormona's abundance.

Planet Mormona was designed to be a garden: a house of healing and rejuvenation for the fallen ones and their spirit guides.  The blue-green water world is just that: blue and green.  These are defining aesthetics of this home which necessarily constrain solutions.  When one thinks of fresh water and green grass, one ponders a rural, agrarian lifestyle.  A life where less is more.  A neo-luddite system that challenges the intention of any technology based on the foundational objective:  does the technology align with Mormona?  Does the technology reduce labor inputs or maximize green outputs?

Consider for example potential power sources.  Converting water to energy (cold fusion) aligns with the planet Mormona and theoretically may represent the ultimate source of power for this planet.  Nuclear power does not.  Geothermal heating/cooling solutions again aligns with connecting to Great Earth Mother.  More so than other solutions such as wind or solar.  Yet solar, if properly done may be a water-based and useful solution.  If we only had a battery-storage solution that relied on water or an abundant resource from Great Earth Mother (e.g., bauxite as aluminum); not on rare earth minerals.

Okay, so the task is simple enough.  First, we design a system whereby we can create food/clothes/housing in a sustainable way.  What people do in this system is also very important.  They should be focused on enhancing the system for the common good, maintaining the system, and healing (that is, getting closer to the Great Healer, Great Earth Mother).  So if we need computers, fine!  But they should be systems that anchor to the foundational principles of minimalist designs and have a life-cycle of 30+ years.  They should enhance self-healing not sabotage or avoid it.

!['e' as 'o'](https://github.com/MonteShaffer/rml-intro/blob/main/images/e-o-V1-pdf65.png?raw=true) 

The Budge dictionary of Egyptian phrases explains that 'Mermena' may be pronounced 'Mormona' or possibly even 'Mormone" and appears in three funerary texts from late Old Kingdom Period related to Sixth Dynasty pharaohs:  Pepi I Meryre,  Merenre, and Pepi II Neferkare.  'Mormona' may be considered a special lake that connects the other world to this world.  Over time, this title may have been repurposed as an ancient river-island society of Meroë in Egypt, Mārôm heights in the land of Naphtali in the Old Testament (see H4791 [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h4791/kjv/wlc/0-1/] and Josh 11:7 [https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/jos/11/7/t_conc_198007]), and the Waters of Mormon in the Book of Mormon.

Furthermore, 'Mer' and 'men' seems to be related roots of the word 'Mermena'.  'Mer' can generically mean "lake or canal" which we would naturally associate with fresh-water to either drink or water crops.
